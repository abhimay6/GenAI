Objective:

Create a user-friendly interface (UI) that takes in client medical history text and provides guidance on whether the customer can be insured, what underwriting requirements are needed (if any), and suggests specific actions for underwriters.

Requirements:

1.
User Input: Create a text area where users can input client medical history.

2.
Guidance Section: Provide guidance on whether the customer can be insured based on their medical history and the uninsured case (Appendices>uninsured). If not, provide a reason for denial (e.g., "High blood pressure" or "History of heart attack").

4.
Underwriting Requirements: If the customer is eligible for insurance, display specific underwriting requirements (e.g., "ECG test required" or "Additional documentation needed from doctor").

5.
Simple UI: Design a simple and intuitive interface using Streamlit.
